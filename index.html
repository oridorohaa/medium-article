  <h1>A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words </h1>
  <p>Picasso's Guernica</p>

  <h2>War of Guernica</h2>
  <p>Picasso’s painting depicts the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica on April 26, 1937. Franco’s German and Italian allies in the Spanish Civil War carpet-bombed Guernica, a stronghold of Republican opposition to Franco’s Nationalists, for hours. Casualty estimates vary from 200 to 1000 deaths. To make matters worse, Franco and his allies blamed the horrific attack on Republican forces.</p>
  <h2>Behind the Painting</h2>
  <p>Pablo Picasso's Guernica is filled with intricate imagery and hidden symbolism, and is considered by many art historians to be the 'single greatest piece of protest art'. </p>

    <h2>The Terrified Horse Is The Guernican People</h2>
    <p>The horse, which likewise stands in the middle of the painting, is the single largest figure in the entire composition. Because horses are usually viewed as friends during warfare because to their role in combat, <strong>the horse might represent the people of Guernica </strong> who are fighting for survival. Despite its apparent distress, the horse's head continues to rise, indicating that it is fighting for its life. This might be interpreted as a symbol of the people's perseverance in the face of fascism.</p>
    <p>The picture of a <strong>human skull may be seen in the horse's nostrils </strong> and teeth if you look attentively. This photograph, like all of Guernica's images, may be interpreted in a multitude of ways. The skull might be another symbol of the people's sorrow, and it certainly emphasises the magnitude of the loss and damage that occurred that day.</p>

  <h2>Defaced</h2>
  <p>In 1974, an antiwar activist and artist, <strong>Tony Shafrazi, would deface the mural with red spray paint </strong> as a protest statement. It was on display at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art at the time. Curators immediately cleaned the painting, and Shafrazi went to jail, charged with criminal mischief. <br> Picasso was adamant that Guernica remains at the Met until Spain re-established a democratic republic. It would not be until 1981, after both the artist's and Franco's deaths, that Spanish negotiators were finally able to bring the mural home.</p>

    <h2>The Bull May Signify Fascism</h2>
    <p>When poet Juan Larrea first mentioned Guernica to Picasso and offered it as a subject for a painting, Picasso stated he had no clue what a city might look like after such an incident. <strong>"a bull in a China shop, run amok."</strong> Larrea stated. In the instance of Guernica, the bull in issue might have been Franco and the fascist state's overwhelming force. It's also commonly believed that Picasso saw the bull as a symbol of cruelty and darkness, which lends credence to the view of it as a symbol of fascism.</p>
